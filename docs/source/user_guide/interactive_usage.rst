Interactive Usage
*****************

.. introduction of what interactive is, note that it's a front end to functionality, when you should or shouldn't use, link to notebooks

This page details the usage of RAIL in interactive mode. RAIL can be run
interactively, such as in a Jupyter notebook. This interactive mode provides a
user-friendly front-end to RAIL functionality. It is the recommended mode of
usage for:

* exploring the functionality, stages, and objects of RAIL
* developing new workflows and pipelines
* operating on smaller data sets
* integrating other code bases

To see examples of how to use RAIL in interactive mode, visit the
:ref:`interactive mode notebooks` page.

To see the interactive mode API reference, visit the :ref:`interactive api` page.

To learn how to run RAIL in pipeline mode, visit the :ref:`pipeline usage` page.
