Configuring RAIL for input data
*******************************

====================================
Variation in input catalog structure
====================================

`RAIL` is designed to be used with a variety of different data.
Depending on the data in question, things like the names of the
columns associted to the particular quantities like the true redshift
of a simulated object, or the names of the columns with the various
observed magnitudes in different filters, will vary.  By enforcing
consistency in naming conventions between different `RailStage`
sub-classes we have made it simple configure `RAIL` to read data from
a particular source, rather than having to edit the configurations
for many different `RailStages`.

When using a single stage (e.g. testing an algorithm in a Jupyter notebook), 
it is also possible to overwrite the default settings for the input data
directly for the stage, without involving the shared parameters, by simply 
specifying catalog information in the `make_stage` step. For example, your input
catalog may have band names like "{band}_gaap1p0Mag", which is different from the 
default values in RAIL. To set this in `MyFavouriteInformer`, do 
`MyFavouriteEstimator.make_stage(band = [f"{band}_gaap1p0Mag" for band in "ugrizy"])`. 
Note that typically a stage may require changes in multiple input parameters 
(e.g. `err_bands` and `ref_bands` needs to be changed accordingly).
Note also that if the user wants to run `MyFavouriteEstimator` next, they will need to repeat
this for the `make_stage` for the estimator. This is why, in case the user is running
many stages, using shared parameters below are preferred.
