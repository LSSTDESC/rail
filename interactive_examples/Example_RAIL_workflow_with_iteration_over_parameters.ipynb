    "This notebook shows how to run through the various [stages of RAIL](https://descraildocs.z27.web.core.windows.net/source/rail_stages/what_are_rail_stages.html) (creation, estimation, evaluation) in order to create a simulated dataset of galaxy magnitudes and redshifts, use the magnitudes to estimate photometric redshifts, and then compare the resulting estimated photometric redshifts to the *true* redshifts. We will be using the [K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm](https://rail-hub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/estimators.html#k-nearest-neighbor) (KNN) to estimate redshifts, and testing out how the limits on the number of nearest neighbours affect the resulting esimated redshift distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we loop over the estimation and evaluation stages while varying these parameters to test their effect. We will also then be exploring how we can parallelize this loop within the notebook to speed things up a little. However, if you are running on very large datasets, we recommend running in pipeline mode instead (see instructions [here](https://descraildocs.z27.web.core.windows.net/source/user_guide/pipeline_usage.html)), as it is not possible to loop over large files with the interactive mode of RAIL. \n",

    "For the test data set, we only apply the `lsst_error_model` degradations, as well as making the above structural changes to get the data in the same output format as the training data set. This is beause we want to be able to compare the estimated redshifts to the true redshifts later on, and to do this when applying cuts can get a bit complicated. If you want to see how this works, we go into detail about this in the the [Exploring_the_Effects_of_Degraders.ipynb]() notebook. "

    "**The algorithm**:  The `K-Nearest Neighbours` algorithm we're using (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) for more of an explanation of how it works) is a wrapper around `sklearn`'s nearest neighbour (NN) machine learning model. Essentially, it takes a given galaxy, identifies its nearest neighbours in the space, in this case galaxies that have similar colours, and then constructs the photometric redshift PDF as a sum of Gaussians from each neighbour.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Inform**: The inform method is training the model that we will use to estimate the redshifts. We will plug in our training data set, and any parameters the model needs. The parameters that we need for this algorithm are the minimum and maximum neighbour limits, which we'll be iterating over. These set the minimum and maximum possible number of neighbours that the model will use to estimate a galaxy's redshift. They do not set the specific number of neighbours it will use, just the range it will test. A larger range will require more computing time. The inform method will also set aside some of the training data set as a validation data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimate**: Once our model is trained, we can then use it to estimate the redshifts of the test data set. We provide the estimate algorithm with the test data set, and the model that we've trained, and any other necessary parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common parameters:\n",
    "- `nondetect_val`: This tells the code which values are considered non-detections. We pass in `np.nan` here, since that's what we used as the `ndFlag` in the degradation stage for non-detections. \n",
