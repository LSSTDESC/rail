# Interactive Example Notebooks

(For now) this folder follows the structure of `rail/examples`. Notebooks are added as
they are ported to work with the interactive module of rail.

## Intentionally Absent Notebooks

These notebooks do not make sense in the interactive context, and so are omitted

- core_examples/
  - 00_Useful_Utilities.ipynb
  - 01_FileIO_DataStore.ipynb
