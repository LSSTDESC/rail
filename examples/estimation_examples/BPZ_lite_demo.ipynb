    "## running BPZliteEstimator with a pre-existing model\n",
    "\n",
    "BPZ is a template-fitting code that works by calculating the chi^2 value for observed photometry and errors compared with a grid of theoretical photometric fluxes generated from a set of template SEDs at each of a grid of redshift values.  These chi^2 values are converted to likelihoods.  If desired, a Bayesian prior can be applied that parameterizes the expected distribution of galaxies in terms of both probability of a \"broad\" SED type as a function of apparent magnitude, and the probability of a galaxy being at a certain redshift given broad SED type and apparent magnitude.  The product of this prior and the likelihoods is then summed over the SED types to return a marginalized posterior PDF, or p(z) for each galaxy.  If the config option `no_prior` is set to `True`, then no prior is applied, and BPZliteEstimator will return a likelihood for each galaxy rather than a posterior.\n",

    "\n",
    "`bpz-1.99.3`, the code written by Dan Coe and Narcisso Benitez and available at https://www.stsci.edu/~dcoe/BPZ/, uses a default set of eight SED templates: four templates from Coleman, Wu, & Weedman (CWW, one Elliptical, two Spirals Sbc and Scd, and one Irregular), two starburst (WB) templates, and two very blue star forming templates generated using Bruzual & Charlot models with very young ages of 25Myr and 5Myr.  The original BPZ paper, Benitez(2000) computed a \"default\" prior fit to data from the Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN).  A pickle file with these parameters and the default SEDs are included with RAIL, named `CWW_HDFN_prior.pkl`.  You can run BPZliteEstimator with these default templates and priors without doing any training, the equivalent of \"running BPZ with the defaults\" had you downloaded bpz-1.99.3 and run it.  **Note, however**, that the cosmoDC2_v1.1.4 dataset has a population of galaxy SEDs that are fairly different from the \"default\" CWWSB templates, and the prior distributions do not exactly match.  So, you will get results that do not look particularly good.  We will demonstrate that use case here, though, as it is the most simple way to run the code out of the box (and illustrates the dangers of grabbing code and running it out of the box):\n",

    "## BPZliteInformer: training a custom prior\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to go beyond the default prior, there is an `BPZliteInformer` stage that allows you to use a training dataset to fit a custom parameterized prior that better matches the magnitude and type distributions of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "`bpz-1.99.3` and our local fork, `DESC_BPZ` both parameterize the Bayesian prior using the form described in Benitez (2000), where the individual SED types are grouped into \"broad types\", e.g. 1 Elliptical makes up one type, the two spirals (Sbc and Scd) make up a second, and the five remaining \"blue\" templates (Im, SB3, SB2, ssp25Myr, and ssp5Myr) make up a third type.  This grouping is somewhat ad-hoc, but does have physical motivation, in that we have observed that Ellipticals, spirals, and irregular/starburst galaxies do show distinctly evolving observed fractions as a function of apparent/absolute magnitude and redshift.  Things get more complicated with more complex SED sets that contain variations in dust content, star formation histories, emission lines, etc...  Due to such complications, the **current** implementation of `BPZliteInformer` leaves the assignment of a \"broad-SED-type\" to the user, and these broad types are a necessary input to `BPZliteInformer` via the `type_file` config option.  In the future, determination of broad SED type will be added as a pre-processing step to the rail_bpz package.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to obtain these broad SED types is to run `DESC_BPZ` with the parameter `ONLY_TYPE` set to `yes`.  When the `ONLY_TYPE` option is turned on in `DESC_BPZ`, the code returns a best-fit SED type evaluated only at the spectroscopic redshift for the object (determined as the best chi^2 amongst the N templates).  The user then needs to map these N integers down to a set of \"broad-type\" integers corresponding to however they wish to define the mapping from N SED types to M broad types.  As an example, I have done this using the CWWSB templates and the 1 Ell, 2 Sp, and 5 Im/SB broad type mapping for our `test_dc2_training_9816.hdf5` dataset. \n",
    "The file with these broad types, named `test_dc2_training_9816_broadtypes.hdf5` is available to download from NERSC, and for convenience, can be downloaded via the built-in RAIL command line tool with:<br>\n",
    "`!rail get-data --bpz-demo-data` in the cell below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now, let's set up our inform stage to calculate a new prior.  We will name the new prior `test_9816_demo_prior.pkl`, setting this as the `model` config parameter will tell `BPZliteInformer` to save our trained model by that name in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we run `inform` it will display values for the parameters as the minimizer runs, including final values for the parameters.  You do not need to pay attention to these values, though if you are curious you can plot them up and compare to the distributions of the HDFN prior."

    "For the ellipticals and spirals at magnitudes 23 and 25, we see that the mean redshift and shape of the prior are similar, but the amplitudes are dramatically different: the HDFN prior is telling us that you are more likely to be an irregular/starburst galaxy than an elliptical or spiral at our two example magnitudes, whereas our custom prior has a higher probability for spirals at fainter magnitudes.  We also see that the custom prior is predicting a slightly different redshift distribution and higher mean redshift than the HDFN prior for irregular/starburst galaxies.  At magnitude 20 we see almost no probability of being an irregular galaxy in our custom prior.  In both priors, the probability of being an irregular/starburst increases dramatically as we go fainter in apparent magnitude, consistent with our expectations of galaxy evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final posterior PDF is a product of the marginalized likelihood as a function of redshift and type, and thus the effect of the prior depends heavily on the \"peakiness\" of the likelihood: with a high chi^2 in flux/color space leading to very high likelihoods, the prior should not have a dramatic effect on the posterior.  For lower chi^2 values and galaxies with low S/N where the likelihoods are broad in redshift, the prior can have more dramatic results, often pushing the PDF to higher or lower redshifts.  The exception can be if the prior for a particular redshift or type goest to zero.  For example, our custom prior assigns almost zero prior probability of a galaxy being an irregular at 20th magnitude.  So, no matter how high the likelihood the prior is for one of the irregular templates, the prior will quash this and any probability from the elliptical or spiral templates is likely to dominate in the final marginalized posterior.  In general, the redshift distributions as a function of apparent magnitude become very broad at fainter magnitudes, and so this \"strong prior\" case only occurs at very bright apparent magnitudes.  Given the power law shape of apparent magnitude number counts, this means that this only affects a small number of galaxies.  "

    "We generally consistent performance, but with small shifts (particularly at higher redshift), and some noticeable changes in the outliers.  This is about what we would expect, as our priors are fairly broad, and the redshif/type distributions for our cosmoDC2 data is not massively different than that described by the HDFN prior (except at very bright magnitudes, which may just be due to very small numbers of those bright galaxies in our training set, and which only affects a very small portion of our test sample, e.g. only 318 of our test_sample galaxies have `mag_i_lsst < 21.0`). Overall, the Bayesian prior should only have a dramatic effect on low S/N galaxies with fairly broad PDFs. For high S/N galaxies like those in our \"gold\" sample tested here, the chi^2 and likelihood values should dominate, and the prior should mostly cause minor changes.  The exception can be on bimodal PDFs, where the prior may increase one peak and decrease the other, moving the mode from a catastrophic outlier to a reasonable estimate, or vice-versa.

That is a good thing, as again, we do not want our prior to dominate photo-z calculations for high signal-to-noise data.  Also, in all cases above we are using the same template set, and the template set used is also part of the implicit prior of the code, and can have a much larger effect on the results: our chi^2 values, and thus likelihoods for each galaxy at each redshift, are measured relative to the fluxes predicted for the templates.
